            <h2 class="h2">Adventure Time</h2>
            <p class="text">It is rightly said, “Jobs fill your pockets but adventures fill your soul”. Most people view
                adventure as
                something that is undertaken as a break from the mundane routine, for others adventure is a way of life.
                You will find below a number of short and long paragraphs on Adventure. We hope these Adventure
                paragraphs will help students in completing their school assignments. These will also help children to
                write and read out paragraphs with simple words and small sentences. Students can select any paragraph
                on Adventure according to their particular requirement.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adventure trips are all about making memories, gaining more knowledge, learning new things about the
                surroundings and about one's own self and making lots of great stories. Going for an adventure camp is
                the best way to get all of these as it forces one to get out of their ordinary lives and try new things.
                Adventure camp basically means spending the nights in tents and doing various activities at the
                camp-site. There are many activities included in camping to make it more exciting and interesting.

                <h2 class="desc">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Paragliding is a sport in which the players fly in the air using paragliders. These
                paragliders are light in weight and are foot launched. There is a harness in the glider on which the
                paraglider sits. This harness is interconnected to the glider with baffled cells. We will learn
                various aspects of this adventurous in the chapters that follow.
                To compete in this sport, the player must have adequate license for paragliding and all other
                related documents present with him before the competition. The distance covered by the player is
                transformed into points through computer in IGC format.
                <br>
                <br>
                Paragliding demands jumping from high heels and to ski in the air for long hours. Therefore, a hill
                station having a stiff peak and a wide area for surfing in the air will be a suitable environment.
                If it will be played in any normal crowded area, then it is obvious that the user will face
                difficulty while paragliding.
                The area must also be free from any airline path so that the player should not face any emergency
                landing system due to an airplane approach. Adequate safety and protection must be taken care of
                before flying so that player can fly comfortably for long hours.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is the sport of riding waves in an upright or prone position. Surfers catch
                the ocean, river, or man-made waves and glide across the surface of the water until they break
                and lose their energy.
                In the ocean, wave riders stand up on surfboards and navigate the water - nearly parallel to the
                beach - toward the shore.
                There are four types of surfing waves: spilling waves, plunging waves, surging waves, and
                collapsing waves.
                The ultimate goal of surfing is to ride and progress on the unbroken part of the wave using a
                Nevertheless, beginners can learn to surf in the whitewater part of the wave.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first English-speaking person to write about wave riding was James Cook.
                The eighteenth-century sea captain and ocean explorer wrote about canoe surfing and board
                surfing during his stops in Hawaii and Tahiti between 1777 and 1779.
                Modern surfing was born on the sands of Waikiki, on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, when the first
                local beach boys began taking tourists to the surf for wave-riding experiences.
                Duke Kahanamoku is widely considered the father of modern surfing.
                He made it a physical recreation, an outdoor activity with rules, gear, and techniques, and
                business.
