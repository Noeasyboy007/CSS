                                        Chicken Momos is a dish that needs no introduction. However, it is pretty easy
                                        to prepare
                                        it at home without putting in much effort. Here's how you go about preparing it
                                        at home: To
                                        begin with, rinse the veggies and chicken with lukewarm water to thoroughly
                                        clean them. Then
                                        take a clean chopping board, chop the vegetables separately and keep them aside.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Step 2 Boil the chicken and then shred well
                                        Then take a pan or a pressure cooker and boil the chicken, with a pinch of salt
                                        and pepper.
                                        If you want to make it aromatic, you can add a small teaspoon of ginger and
                                        chilli garlic
                                        paste. If you like the flavour of garlic, you can add some more garlic paste.
                                        Once done,
                                        carefully mince the boiled chicken. Keep it aside.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Step 3 Prepare the dough and filling for Chicken Momos
                                        Now, take a deep mixing bowl and add refined oil in it followed by all-purpose
                                        flour and salt.
                                        Mix well with enough water and knead the mixture into a smooth dough. Knead well
                                        and ensure
                                        that no lumps are formed. Take another mixing bowl and add chicken followed by
                                        chopped vegetables,
                                        mix well and combine everything together. Then, add soy sauce to the chicken mix
                                        and stir well.
                                        Now take the prepared dough and roll out small balls out of it.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Step 4 Flatten the dough balls and fill it with chicken stuffing, and steam for
                                        20 minutes
                                        Using a rolling pin, flatten the balls in a square shape and add the chicken and
                                        veggies stuffing
                                        at the centre. Bring the edges close and secure them to make a momo. Repeat this
                                        step with the
                                        remaining balls. Transfer the prepared momos to a steamer and steam for 20
                                        minutes or until they
                                        turn soft and tender. Serve fresh and hot with your choice of chutney or dip.

                                <ol>
                                    <li>Step 1 Wash the chicken and prepare the marinade

                                        water and rinse it again in cold water. Then take a large bowl and combine

                                        properly. You can also drizzle a little water to the batter to coat the chicken
                                        pieces evenly. Once done, refrigerate the chicken for 1-2 hours.

                                        Remove and drain excess oil on absorbent paper. Meanwhile, heat 1 or 2 tbsps of
                                        oil in a separate pan over medium flame. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, add
                                        the onions and fry for 2-3 minutes till they turn translucent. Then add the

                                        extra spicy, you can also add some vinegar-soaked green chillies to this recipe,
                                        as it adds to the taste and flavour. (optional)
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Step 3 Cook chicken in soy sauce & vinegar
                                        When the veggies are partially cooked, add soy sauce, vinegar, chicken and salt.
                                        Mix all the ingredients well and make sure that the chicken is well coated in
                                        the sauces. Keep stirring so that the chicken does not stick to the pan.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Step 4 Toss the Chilli Chicken and serve hot
